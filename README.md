This repo represents my journey with Machine Learning. I am reading through Aurelien Geron ML book and doing the excercises, and I am also doing Kaggle excercises. 

## Housing file
This file contains code of the tutorial and project I did in the book. I learned learning algorithms such as linear regression and k-Nearest Neighbors
and the steps for a machine learning project such as visualizing data to discover patterns, cleaning data, and etc. I applied this knowledge with a practical project
in which I had to predict the prices of houses in Calfornia based off given paramters.

## Walmart file
I attacked a Kaggle project in which I had to predict the sales of an individual Walmart store based off previous sales data. I learned how to effectively find 
patterns in the data by calculating statisical figures plotting the data on graphs using mathplot lib. I got confused half way through so I looked at the answers
to make sure my understanding was correct. As a result, not all of it is my code.

## Classification file
This file contains code of the classifcation tutorial in the book. I learned what algorithms work well with classifcation tasks such as binary classfication
and multi-class classifcation. Additionally, I learned important performance metric such as precision, recall, and f1 score. I graphed the precision vs recall curve
and the roc curve to understand the tradeoff. In the end, I created a classifer that can classify hand written digits from the MNIST database and used grid 
search to find effective metrics to improve performance.

## Titanic file
I attempted the titanic project on Kaggle in which I have to predict if a passenger would survive based off paramters. This entire project is my code. 
It displays my improvement in my ML journey because I do not have to look up basic documentation to train a model or clean the data. In this project, I learned
how to effectively create custom Imputers and pipelines and measure the performance of the learning algorithms I trained. I also improved my data to manipulate 
data better with pandas.
